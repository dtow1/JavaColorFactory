  "body": "### Color Factory\r\nThis project was for my Advanced Java class at City College of San Francisco in December of 2015. The purpose of the class is to allow you to select a color by changing RGB sliders. It also provides the numeric values of the sliders so that you can recreate the color. The values can be displayed in decimal, binary, octal, or hexadecimal.\r\n\r\n### Topics\r\nThe program uses the Java SE and the graphics are handled using awt and swing. While creating this project I learned about GUI programming in Java and multithreading. It was fairly simple to design and the only (minor) challenge was keeping the animation from flickering. The key to this was to only redraw portions of the canvas that were changing and leaving everything else as is.\r\n\r\n### Creating pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJason Boyer\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.jasonrboyer.com\">Author's website</a>\r\n",
